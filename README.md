Guess the States Game

This is a Python-based game using Turtle for graphical interaction and Pandas for data handling. The goal is to guess all the states in a given dataset. If a player decides to exit before completing the game, the missing states are saved in a CSV file for later learning.

Features

Interactive map-based guessing using the Turtle module.

Pandas is used to handle the dataset efficiently.

Type the state names to guess them.

Enter "exit" to quit early and save the missing states in a CSV file.


Requirements:

Make sure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:

pip install pandas turtle

How to Play

1. Run the script.


2. Type the names of the states in the input prompt.


3. Correct guesses will be displayed on the map.


4. Type "exit" to quit. The game will generate a missing_states.csv file with the states you didnâ€™t guess.



Learning from Mistakes

After exiting, open missing_states.csv to review and learn the states you missed.
